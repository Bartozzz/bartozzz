#### Hi, I am _Bartosz ≈Åaniewski_ üëã

I have excellent knowledge of front-end development. I‚Äôm comfortable in technologies such as CSS Modules, CSS Preprocessors, JavaScript inline styling as well as build tools such as Gulp and Webpack. I am confident in understanding documentation when introducing a new framework or library.

I have a deep understanding of component-based frameworks, such as React and Vue.js. I have a testing mindset and an eye for clean code. I care about code quality, consistency, reusability ‚Äì that‚Äôs why I value functional programming and strong typing (TypeScript, Flow).

Beyond front-end, I am passionate about creating robust, scalable, and secure systems. As a full-stack developer, I can integrate user-facing elements with server-side logic. I adhere to the best infosec and DevOps practices. I always write reusable code and libraries.
